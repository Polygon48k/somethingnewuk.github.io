I'm Lewis Sturrock, a Lecturer in Computing & Digital Media, contributor to charitable projects, and local resident. I have interests in technology, sustainability, economics and education. I'm standing for Parliament in the 2017 general election because I believe every member of society has the power to contribute to a better world, given the right tools.

### Something New believes in:

*   Using the best ideas, by building the world's first [open-source political manifesto](/manifesto) that _you_ can add to.
*   Building a sustainable and progressive society for everyone, where nobody is left behind.
*   An open, transparent and accountable government which protects the privacy of its citizens.
*   Taking the right decisions for the long term, not just tomorrow's papers.
*   Rational and evidence-based policy-making, with less room for special interests and lobbying. 

### Local issues:

*   A commitment to reduce the suicide rate in the Highlands.
*   A commitment for all residents to have the same access to services and education regardless of nationalilty.
*   Encourage the highland council to be more accessable to it's rural communities.
*   Support the rights of residents to arrange and promote events.
